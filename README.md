### Things That Keep Me Hooked
- **Japanese music** — The kind where lyrics hide meaning in plain sight, where the mood can turn halfway through a song and hit you out of nowhere.
- **Space** — The scale of the universe is beautiful and terrifying all at once. I’m drawn to that feeling, even if it makes me uneasy.  
- **Patterns** — Whether it’s in code, machines, or people, I notice the details most ignore. Sometimes it’s a blessing. Sometimes… not.

### At the Moment
- Still chasing a project worth calling a “favorite”  
- Learning without meaning to — curiosity’s a bad habit like that  
- Probably overthinking something right now
